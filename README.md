#Game Goal
Motivate younger people who like games to play and learn about history in an interactive way.

#Game Description
The game begins in a main menu where players can choose their
preferred language, adjust settings, view credits, quit, or start playing.
Upon selecting "Play," the player enters a gallery showcasing three
paintings, each representing a unique level. Initially, only the first
painting is interactable. Interacting with a painting transports the player
into its associated level.
Each level starts in a desaturated, white environment with a vibrant
beacon leading to a painter character representing the original creator of
the painting. After interacting with the painter, the world transforms,
gaining color and style inspired by the painting.
The primary objective in each level is to locate and capture a set number
of 'Grimics,' mischievous creatures hidden or moving within the world.
Hidden Grimics are concealed within objects that feel out of place in the
context of the painting. Interacting with these objects reveals the
Grimics, which players can then capture.
Once all Grimics are collected, the scene evolves further, with added
ambiance, sound effects, and visual enhancements. Key interactions
throughout the level trigger contextual dialogue to enrich the narrative
experience.

#Engine
The game is built with Unreal Engine 5.4
